.dotfiles
=========

My OSX development environment .dotfiles and simple scripts to set them up.

Usage
=====

# Ensure you check this repo out into $HOME/.dotfiles

# run the following script in that directory:
  setup_all.sh 
  
# This will (ask) to overwrite a bunch of .dotfiles in your homedir with 
symlinks to those in .dotfiles

# It will also run some other setup scripts

WARNING
=======

This is a very opinionated set-up just for me. I don't recommend anyone use 
it ><; At least not without looking at everything it will do and backing up 
all your own stuff.
